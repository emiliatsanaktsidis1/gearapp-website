<h1>Gear – Buyer Protection Policy</h1>
<p class="meta"><em>Last updated: 13 December 2025</em></p>
<p>Buyer Protection is designed to protect buyers from clear cases of fraud. It is not a general warranty program.</p>
<hr>
<h2>1. What Buyer Protection Covers</h2>
<p>You may be eligible for a refund where Gear determines that fraud occurred, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Non-shipment (no valid tracking or proof of shipment);</li>
  <li>Fake tracking numbers or clearly invalid tracking;</li>
  <li>Receiving an item that is completely different from the listing;</li>
  <li>Receiving a clearly counterfeit item that was listed as genuine.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Disputes and Item Not Received</h2>
<p>If a buyer believes an item has not been received or that a transaction is disputed, the buyer must notify Gear as soon as reasonably possible through the App.</p>
<p>Gear may review available information, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tracking details and courier confirmations;</li>
  <li>Listing descriptions and images;</li>
  <li>Messages between buyer and seller;</li>
  <li>Account history and risk indicators.</li>
</ul>
<p>An item is generally considered delivered when valid tracking information indicates delivery or a delivery attempt at the buyer's address or delivery area.</p>
<p>If a seller cannot provide valid proof of shipment or provides fake or invalid tracking, Gear may treat the transaction as non-shipment and may refund the buyer and reverse or withhold the seller's payout.</p>
<p>If valid tracking shows delivery, courier delays, or in-transit status, the issue is generally considered a courier matter and is not eligible for a refund, unless Gear determines fraud has occurred.</p>
<p>Gear's decision on disputes and non-delivery claims is final.</p>


<h2>Shipping Timeframe</h2>
<p>Sellers must ship items within <strong>5 business days</strong> of payment confirmation, unless a longer handling time is clearly stated in the listing.</p>
<p>If a seller fails to ship an item within the required timeframe and cannot provide valid proof of shipment, Gear may treat the transaction as non-shipment and may refund the buyer and reverse or withhold the seller's payout.</p>

<h2>2. What Buyer Protection Does Not Cover</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Fitment or compatibility issues;</li>
  <li>Change of mind;</li>
  <li>Minor condition disputes where the listing was generally accurate;</li>
  <li>Courier delays or courier-caused damage where the seller shipped as described;</li>
  <li>Non-receipt claims where tracking confirms delivery, unless fraud is proven.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. How to Make a Claim</h2>
<p>Contact Gear through the App and provide order details, evidence (photos/videos), messages, and any courier or tracking information.</p>
