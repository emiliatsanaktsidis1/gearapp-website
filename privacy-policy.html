    <h2>9. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>Our service providers may be located in countries other than your own. As a result, your information may be transferred to and processed in countries that may have different data protection laws. Where required, we take steps to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your information.</p>
