<h1>Gear – Refunds and Returns Policy</h1>
<p class="meta"><em>Last updated: 13 December 2025</em></p>
<p>Gear is a marketplace for car parts. All sales are final except in cases of verified fraud. This policy explains when a refund may be considered.</p>
<hr>

<h2>1. All Sales Are Final</h2>
<p>Unless otherwise required by law, purchases made through Gear are final. Gear does not offer returns or refunds for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Change of mind;</li>
  <li>Fitment or compatibility issues (buyers must check suitability before purchasing);</li>
  <li>Minor condition disputes where the listing was generally accurate;</li>
  <li>Courier delays or missed delivery attempts;</li>
  <li>Damage caused in transit by the courier.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Fraud-Based Refunds</h2>
<p>Gear may issue a refund only where we determine that <strong>fraud</strong> has occurred. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The seller never shipped the item and cannot provide valid proof of shipment;</li>
  <li>The seller provided clearly fake or invalid tracking information;</li>
  <li>The item received is completely different from what was advertised (e.g., empty box, unrelated item);</li>
  <li>The item is clearly counterfeit but was listed as genuine.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Reporting a Problem</h2>
<p>If you believe you have been the victim of fraud, contact Gear as soon as possible and provide:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your order number and listing details;</li>
  <li>Photos of the item and packaging (if received);</li>
  <li>Relevant messages between buyer and seller;</li>
  <li>Any tracking information or courier evidence.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Investigation and Outcomes</h2>
<p>Gear may review listing details, messages, tracking, account history, and other available evidence. Based on our review, Gear may:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Refund the buyer and reverse or withhold the seller’s payout;</li>
  <li>Deny the refund request;</li>
  <li>Restrict or suspend an account for policy breaches.</li>
</ul>
<p>Gear’s decision is final.</p>
