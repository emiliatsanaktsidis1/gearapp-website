    <h1>Shipping &amp; Protection</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: 6 February 2026</p>
    <p>This page contains Gear's policies on shipping, buyer protection, and seller protection. These policies are incorporated into and form part of the <a href="terms-of-service.html">Terms of Service</a>.</p>

    <hr class="section-divider">

    <!-- SHIPPING POLICY -->
    <h2>Shipping Policy</h2>
    <p>Gear is a marketplace platform. We do not physically handle, package, or ship items. Shipping is arranged and completed by sellers and their chosen couriers.</p>

    <h3>1. Seller Responsibilities</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Accurately state shipping options, dispatch timeframes, and shipping costs in the listing.</li>
      <li>Package items safely and securely to reduce damage in transit.</li>
      <li>Ship within the timeframe stated on the listing (or within a reasonable time if no timeframe is stated).</li>
      <li>Provide valid tracking information where available.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Buyer Responsibilities</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide a complete and accurate delivery address at checkout.</li>
      <li>Review shipping options and costs before purchasing.</li>
      <li>Monitor tracking updates and contact the courier where appropriate.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Tracking and Delivery</h3>
    <p>An order is generally considered delivered when courier tracking indicates <strong>Delivered</strong> or an equivalent status (including delivery attempt at the buyer's address).</p>
    <p>If tracking shows delivery to the correct area/address, Gear will not normally treat the order as undelivered unless there is evidence of fraud or a courier-confirmed delivery error.</p>

    <h3>4. Lost Shipments</h3>
    <p>If an item is confirmed lost in transit by the shipping carrier:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Buyer:</strong> Will receive a full refund. Buyers should not pay for items they never received.</li>
      <li><strong>Seller:</strong> The pending payout will not be released. Sellers may lodge a claim with the shipping carrier or their shipping insurance provider to recover the item value.</li>
      <li><strong>Gear:</strong> Facilitates the refund process but does not absorb shipping carrier losses.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.1 Tracked Shipments (Recommended)</h3>
    <p>If tracking confirms the parcel is lost:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The buyer receives a full refund.</li>
      <li>The seller's payout is not released (because delivery never occurred).</li>
      <li>The seller can lodge a claim with the courier (Australia Post, Sendle, etc.) to recover the item value.</li>
      <li>If the seller purchased shipping insurance, they can claim the full item value from the insurer.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.2 Untracked Shipments</h3>
    <p>If the seller shipped without tracking:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the buyer reports non-delivery, the buyer is refunded.</li>
      <li>The seller's payout is not released.</li>
      <li>Without tracking, there is no proof of delivery, so the seller absorbs the loss.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>We strongly recommend using tracked shipping for all orders.</strong></p>

    <h3>5. "Delivered" But Not Received</h3>
    <p>If tracking shows "Delivered" but the buyer claims non-receipt:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Check surroundings:</strong> Buyer should check with neighbours, building reception, or safe drop locations.</li>
      <li><strong>Wait 48 hours:</strong> Sometimes parcels are scanned delivered prematurely.</li>
      <li><strong>Contact Gear support:</strong> If the item still cannot be located after 48 hours.</li>
      <li><strong>High-value items ($200+):</strong> Gear may request a statutory declaration or police report before processing a refund.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If tracking confirms delivery to the correct address, the seller is generally protected and the payout will proceed.</p>

    <h3>6. Damaged Shipments</h3>
    <p>If an item arrives damaged due to transit:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Document immediately:</strong> Take photos of the item and packaging before discarding anything.</li>
      <li><strong>Report to seller:</strong> Notify the seller within 48 hours of receipt.</li>
      <li><strong>Carrier claim:</strong> The seller should lodge a damage claim with the shipping carrier.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Gear does not cover damage caused by shipping carriers, but may assist in dispute resolution. Sellers who purchase shipping insurance can claim damages from their insurance provider.</p>

    <h3>7. Delayed Shipments</h3>
    <p>Delays caused by couriers, customs, weather, or operational issues are outside Gear's control. Gear does not provide refunds for delayed deliveries.</p>

    <h3>8. Shipping Recommendations for Sellers</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Use tracked shipping:</strong> Protects you with proof of delivery and allows you to claim from the courier if lost.</li>
      <li><strong>Consider shipping insurance:</strong> For high-value items, insurance allows you to recover the full item value if lost or damaged.</li>
      <li><strong>Package securely:</strong> Use appropriate packaging materials to prevent damage in transit.</li>
      <li><strong>Keep receipts:</strong> Retain shipping receipts and proof of postage for your records.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr class="section-divider">

    <!-- BUYER PROTECTION -->
    <h2>Buyer Protection Policy</h2>
    <p>Buyer Protection is designed to protect buyers from clear cases of fraud. It is not a general warranty program.</p>

    <h3>1. What Buyer Protection Covers</h3>
    <p>You may be eligible for a refund where Gear determines that fraud occurred, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Non-shipment (no valid tracking or proof of shipment);</li>
      <li>Fake tracking numbers or clearly invalid tracking;</li>
      <li>Receiving an item that is completely different from the listing;</li>
      <li>Receiving a clearly counterfeit item that was listed as genuine.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Disputes and Item Not Received</h3>
    <p>If a buyer believes an item has not been received or that a transaction is disputed, the buyer must notify Gear as soon as reasonably possible through the App.</p>
    <p>Gear may review available information, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tracking details and courier confirmations;</li>
      <li>Listing descriptions and images;</li>
      <li>Messages between buyer and seller;</li>
      <li>Account history and risk indicators.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>An item is generally considered delivered when valid tracking information indicates delivery or a delivery attempt at the buyer's address or delivery area.</p>
    <p>If a seller cannot provide valid proof of shipment or provides fake or invalid tracking, Gear may treat the transaction as non-shipment and may refund the buyer and reverse or withhold the seller's payout.</p>
    <p>If valid tracking shows delivery, courier delays, or in-transit status, the issue is generally considered a courier matter and is not eligible for a refund, unless Gear determines fraud has occurred.</p>
    <p>Gear's decision on disputes and non-delivery claims is final.</p>

    <h3>3. Lost Parcels</h3>
    <p>If your parcel is confirmed lost in transit by the shipping carrier:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>You will receive a full refund.</strong> Buyers should not pay for items they never received.</li>
      <li>The seller's payout will be withheld and the seller can lodge a claim with the shipping carrier.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3.1 "Delivered" But Not Received</h3>
    <p>If tracking shows "Delivered" but you haven't received your item:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Check your surroundings:</strong> Look around your property, check with neighbours, and contact building reception if applicable.</li>
      <li><strong>Wait 48 hours:</strong> Sometimes parcels are scanned as delivered prematurely.</li>
      <li><strong>Contact Gear support:</strong> If the item still cannot be located after 48 hours, contact us through the App.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For high-value orders ($200+), Gear may request additional verification (such as a statutory declaration or police report) before processing a refund where tracking confirms delivery.</p>

    <h3>4. Shipping Timeframe</h3>
    <p>Sellers must ship items within <strong>5 business days</strong> of payment confirmation, unless a longer handling time is clearly stated in the listing.</p>
    <p>If a seller fails to ship an item within the required timeframe and cannot provide valid proof of shipment, Gear may treat the transaction as non-shipment and may refund the buyer and reverse or withhold the seller's payout.</p>

    <h3>5. What Buyer Protection Does Not Cover</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Fitment or compatibility issues;</li>
      <li>Change of mind;</li>
      <li>Minor condition disputes where the listing was generally accurate;</li>
      <li>Courier delays or courier-caused damage where the seller shipped as described;</li>
      <li>Non-receipt claims where tracking confirms delivery, unless fraud is proven.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6. How to Make a Claim</h3>
    <p>Contact Gear through the App and provide order details, evidence (photos/videos), messages, and any courier or tracking information.</p>

    <hr class="section-divider">

    <!-- SELLER PROTECTION -->
    <h2>Seller Protection Policy</h2>
    <p>Seller Protection is intended to protect honest sellers from unfair refund demands and abusive behaviour, while still allowing Gear to act in cases of fraud.</p>

    <h3>1. When Seller Protection Applies</h3>
    <p>Sellers are generally protected when they:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Accurately describe the item, including condition and known defects;</li>
      <li>Ship the correct item as listed;</li>
      <li>Package the item appropriately;</li>
      <li>Provide valid tracking that shows delivery to the buyer's address or delivery area.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Examples Where Sellers Are Protected</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A buyer claims non-delivery but tracking confirms delivery;</li>
      <li>A buyer is unhappy with compatibility or fitment after purchase;</li>
      <li>A buyer reports courier delay after the item was shipped with valid tracking;</li>
      <li>A buyer reports courier damage where the seller shipped the correct item as described.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. When Seller Protection Does Not Apply</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The seller fails to ship or cannot provide valid proof of shipment;</li>
      <li>The seller provides fake or clearly invalid tracking;</li>
      <li>The seller ships a counterfeit item listed as genuine;</li>
      <li>The seller ships an item that is completely different from the listing;</li>
      <li>Other fraudulent or misleading conduct.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Lost Parcels</h3>
    <p>If a parcel is lost in transit:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The buyer will be refunded (buyers should not pay for items they never received).</li>
      <li>The seller's payout will not be released.</li>
      <li><strong>Sellers using tracked shipping</strong> can lodge a claim with the shipping carrier or their insurance provider to recover the item value. This is why we recommend tracked shipping.</li>
      <li><strong>Sellers using untracked shipping</strong> absorb the loss, as there is no proof of shipment or carrier record to claim against.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Gear facilitates the refund process but does not absorb losses caused by shipping carriers. The party at fault (the carrier) is where claims should be directed.</p>

    <h3>5. Gear's Actions</h3>
    <p>Where Gear determines fraud has occurred, Gear may refund the buyer and reverse or withhold the seller's payout, and may restrict or suspend the seller's account.</p>
