<h1>Gear – Shipping Policy</h1>
<p class="meta"><em>Last updated: 13 December 2025</em></p>
<p>Gear is a marketplace platform. We do not physically handle, package, or ship items. Shipping is arranged and completed by sellers and their chosen couriers.</p>
<hr>

<h2>1. Seller Responsibilities</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Accurately state shipping options, dispatch timeframes, and shipping costs in the listing.</li>
  <li>Package items safely and securely to reduce damage in transit.</li>
  <li>Ship within the timeframe stated on the listing (or within a reasonable time if no timeframe is stated).</li>
  <li>Provide valid tracking information where available.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Buyer Responsibilities</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Provide a complete and accurate delivery address at checkout.</li>
  <li>Review shipping options and costs before purchasing.</li>
  <li>Monitor tracking updates and contact the courier where appropriate.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Tracking and Delivery</h2>
<p>An order is generally considered delivered when courier tracking indicates <strong>Delivered</strong> or an equivalent status (including delivery attempt at the buyer’s address).</p>
<p>If tracking shows delivery to the correct area/address, Gear will not normally treat the order as undelivered unless there is evidence of fraud or a courier-confirmed delivery error.</p>

<h2>4. Lost Shipments</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If a seller cannot provide valid proof of shipment or valid tracking, Gear may treat the order as not shipped and may refund the buyer and withhold or reverse the seller’s payout.</li>
  <li>If valid tracking shows the item is in transit, delayed, or held, this is a courier issue. Buyers should contact the courier directly using the tracking details.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Damaged Shipments</h2>
<p>If an item arrives damaged, buyers should document the damage immediately (photos of the item and packaging) and contact the seller and courier as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Gear does not provide refunds purely for courier-caused damage, unless Gear determines there is fraud (for example, the seller shipped an entirely different item).</p>

<h2>6. Delayed Shipments</h2>
<p>Delays caused by couriers, customs, weather, or operational issues are outside Gear’s control. Gear does not provide refunds for delayed deliveries.</p>

<h2>7. Fraud Exception</h2>
<p>Where Gear determines that a seller acted fraudulently (for example, fake tracking or no shipment), Gear may refund the buyer and reverse or withhold the seller’s payout.</p>
